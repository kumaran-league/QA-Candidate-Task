# Playwright or Selenium Candidate Evaluation Questions

This document contains questions designed to assess a candidate's ability to write effective Playwright tests.

1. **End-to-End Login Test**

   - Write a Playwright test that navigates to a login page, fills out a username and password, submits the form, and verifies that a welcome message appears.
   - Explain how you would ensure the test waits properly for page navigation and element visibility.

2. **Integration Testing with an API Endpoint**

   - Write a Playwright test that interacts with a real or mocked API endpoint and verifies that the UI updates based on the response.
   - Describe how you would configure the test environment to run integration tests that depend on backend services.

3. **UI Interaction Validation**

   - Provide a test script that checks whether a dropdown menu becomes visible only when hovering over a specific element.
   - Describe how you would assert that the menu items are hidden before hovering and visible afterward.

4. **Network Request Mocking**
   - Demonstrate how to intercept and mock an API response in Playwright to test a component that relies on network data.
   - Include an explanation of when and why you might use request interception in your test suite.
