# QA-Testing Repository Overview

This repository serves as a practical demonstrations of test automation using various frameworks and languages for assessing QA candidates.

## Test Automation Examples

The repository is structured to provide examples for different testing tools:

- **Playwright:** Contains a complete Playwright test automation setup with sample tests and configuration files.

- **Selenium:** Examples using Selenium are provided for multiple programming languages:
  - `Selenium-java`: Selenium test examples implemented in Java

  - `Selenium-javascript`: Selenium test examples implemented in JavaScript

Each framework folder includes specific setup instructions and placeholder tests designed to mirror common evaluation questions.

## Sample Pages

The `public/` directory contains three sample HTML pages designed for testing different scenarios:

- **login.html**: A simple login form with username/password fields for testing form interactions and authentication flows
- **dropdown.html**: Demonstrates hover-based dropdown menus for testing dynamic UI elements
- **api.html**: Fetches and displays user data from `https://dummyjson.com/users/1` for testing API integration and data rendering

## Candidate Task

The `CandidateTasks.md` file outlines the criteria and questions for evaluating QA candidates.

## How To Setup

Follow the specific instructions within each framework's folder (`Playwright`, `Selenium-java`, etc.) to set up and run the respective examples.
